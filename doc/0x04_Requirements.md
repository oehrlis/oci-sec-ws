# Requirements for Oracle Cloud (OCI) Security Workshop

Have you always wanted to explore the full functionality of the security features of *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)* but never found the time? Then our *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Security - The Practical Workshop* is the perfect opportunity for you. After a theoretical introduction, we will dive straight into practical work in the cloud. Participants will explore various security topics using real-life examples. For the duration of the workshop, you will have access to a dedicated *Oracle Cloud Environment*. All examples and exercises will be stored in a *GitHub* repository, which will remain accessible after the event.

## Prerequisites and Skills

The workshop allows a step-by-step introduction to *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)* security concepts. The following skills are recommended for participants:

- Experience working with shell scripts, SSH, and command-line tools.
- Basic knowledge of Oracle Database fundamentals, such as installation, configuration, and administration.
- Familiarity with Git and *[GitHub](https://github.com/)* is recommended.

## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Environment

The practical exercises will take place in the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)* Console. You will need a laptop with internet access and a modern browser.

Mandatory prerequisites:

- Access to *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)*. Access to an OCI tenant will be provided as part of the workshop.
- Laptop with internet access via conference Wi-Fi.
- A modern browser that supports *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)*. See also [Supported Browsers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#Supporte).
