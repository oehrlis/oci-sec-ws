## Exercise 10: Discover Sensitive Data

In this exercise, you will use Oracle Data Safe to identify and classify sensitive data within your Autonomous Database (ADB). This process helps ensure data privacy and compliance by discovering personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data types.

### Objectives

- Run a data discovery scan in Oracle Data Safe to locate sensitive data.
- Review the results to understand the types and locations of sensitive data within the database.

## Environment {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Perform this exercise within the following environment:

- **Compartment:** `OCI-SEC-WS-LAB-nn`
- **Region:** Germany Central (Frankfurt)
- **OCI Console URL:**  
  [OCI Console Frankfurt - Login](https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Ensure you are in the correct compartment and region. New resources, such as Cloud Shell configurations and ADB access settings, should be created within your designated compartment.

## Solution

## Summary

In this exercise, you:

- Conducted a data discovery scan using Oracle Data Safe to identify sensitive data.
- Reviewed the results to understand the classification and locations of sensitive information in your database.

You are now ready to continue with the next exercise, where you will configure the SQL Firewall to control and monitor SQL queries within the database.
