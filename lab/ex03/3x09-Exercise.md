## Exercise 09: Generate Alerts

In this exercise, you will configure Oracle Data Safe to generate alerts for
specific activities or events within your Autonomous Database (ADB). Setting up
alerts helps you stay informed about critical actions, security incidents, and
potential threats in real-time.

### Objectives

- Configure alert settings in Oracle Data Safe.
- Set up rules to trigger alerts for specific database events.
- Test the alerting mechanism to ensure notifications are received for relevant
  actions.

## Environment {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Perform this exercise within the following environment:

- **Compartment:** `OCI-SEC-WS-LAB-nn`
- **Region:** Germany Central (Frankfurt)
- **OCI Console URL:**  
  [OCI Console Frankfurt - Login](https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com)

Ensure you are in the correct compartment and region. New resources, such as
Cloud Shell configurations and ADB access settings, should be created within
your designated compartment.
