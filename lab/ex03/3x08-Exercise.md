## Exercise 08: Audit Database Activity

In this exercise, you will use Oracle Data Safe to audit database activity in
your Autonomous Database (ADB). Auditing helps monitor actions performed within
the database, providing insights into user activity and helping detect any
suspicious or unauthorized actions.

### Objectives

- Enable and configure auditing in Oracle Data Safe.
- Review and analyze database activity logs to monitor user actions.
