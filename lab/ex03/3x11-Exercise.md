## Exercise 11: SQL Firewall

In this exercise, you will configure the SQL Firewall in Oracle Data Safe to control and monitor SQL queries executed in your Autonomous Database (ADB). This feature helps enhance database security by defining rules that restrict unauthorized or potentially harmful SQL statements.

### Objectives

- Set up the SQL Firewall in Oracle Data Safe.
- Define rules to allow or block specific SQL statements.
- Test the SQL Firewall by executing queries to verify that the rules are enforced.

## Environment {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Perform this exercise within the following environment:

- **Compartment:** `OCI-SEC-WS-LAB-nn`
- **Region:** Germany Central (Frankfurt)
- **OCI Console URL:**  
  [OCI Console Frankfurt - Login](https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Ensure you are in the correct compartment and region. New resources, such as Cloud Shell configurations and ADB access settings, should be created within your designated compartment.

## Solution

## Summary

In this exercise, you:

- Configured the SQL Firewall in Oracle Data Safe to control SQL query execution.
- Defined rules to restrict unauthorized or harmful SQL statements.
- Tested the SQL Firewall by running queries to ensure that the rules are correctly applied.

You have now completed the Data Safe exercises, enhancing your database security capabilities. Continue to explore other security features in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
